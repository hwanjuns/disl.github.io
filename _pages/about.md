Welcome to the `DISL Lab`. We are dedicated to pioneering advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Our vision is centered on the pursuit of `data-centric` approaches that enhance the perofrmance of AI algorithms and systems.

The foundation role of `data` remains unwavering, even as AI trends evolve rapidly. Our research interests involve making innovations with cutting-edge technologies in various domains, including computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Our research scope is expansive and adapts with the advancements in AI. Currently, our primary focus lies in tackling novel challenges in data for `natural language generation`. Additionally, we are actively exploring `data-robust` and `data-efficient` AI modeling, including learning with imperfect data, and AI traning and inference under `real-world setup`, which encompasses continual learning and online adaptation.
